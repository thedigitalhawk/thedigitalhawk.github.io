            <h2 class="subhead">Our History</h2>
            <p>
                The history of AES showcases the company's evolution and success from the energy services industry,
                particularly in the areas of LED retrofit programs and large-scale projects, to a premier warehouse
                solution integrator. Here is a timeline of key milestones in AES's history:
            </p>

            <h4> 2016: Company Foundation</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>AES was founded in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, as an Energy Services Contractor.
                </li>
                <li>The company's initial focus was on reducing carbon footprints by implementing LED retrofit
                    programs for larger industrial and commercial customers.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h4> 2018: Preferred Partner for World's Largest Lighting Retrofit Program</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2018, AES achieved a significant milestone by becoming the preferred partner for the largest
                    lighting retrofit program in the world.
                </li>
                <li>AES became the sole program partner for lighting and electrical services in facilities exceeding
                    50,000 square feet, indicating its leadership in providing turnkey solutions for larger facilities.
                </li>
                <li>The company played a central role in program management, sales, utility incentive capture,
                    implementation, and program maintenance.
                </li>
                <li>This accomplishment positioned AES as a key player in the global lighting retrofit landscape and
                    showcased its expertise in managing large-scale energy efficiency initiatives.
